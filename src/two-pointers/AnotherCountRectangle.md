# Approach

- Initialize two pointers, i and j, at the beginning and end of the sorted array A, respectively.

- Initialize a variable count to 0 to keep track of the count of rectangles with areas less than B.

- Initialize a variable mod to 1000000007, which will be used to calculate the final result modulo this value.

- Enter a loop that continues as long as i is less than or equal to j.

- Calculate the area of the rectangle using the formula area = 1L * A[i] * A[j]. The use of 1L ensures that the multiplication is done as a long integer to prevent overflow.

- Check if the calculated area is less than B. If it is, increment the count by (j - i) * 2 + 1. This step counts all the rectangles with A[i] as length and A[j] as width, as well as the rectangles with A[j] as length and A[i] as width, and adds 1 for the current configuration.

- If the area is greater than or equal to B, decrement the j pointer to consider smaller widths and reduce the area.

- Finally, return the value of count modulo mod as the result. This is done to ensure that the result fits within the integer range.
